Orks are generally perceived by humans as being nothing more than beasts or monsters.
Over time, humans realized that orks had incredible intelligence and culture, and
made poaching them illegal.

Although orks have no real belief in vast "magic", they have always had the ability
to create fire and mold the earth with their bare hands.  Skilled masters are capable
of very elaborite patterns and displays.
