Character race: Human
Age: 20 something
Occupation: Tribal Gatherer

Intro:
	Always on a quest to learn more, our adventurer dreams the big dreams.
One day, while adventuring and gathering for his tribe, he comes across some
people gathered in a clearing standing in a circle.  They seemed to have drawn
some sort of sybol in the ground before them. To him they are doing what looks
like prayers. They being chanting, softly at first, then growing louder and
louder, in a strange language. The sound is both eerie and peacful. He begins
to notice the air around these people is starting to shimmer, then fade.
Suppringly the apperance of the "people" is now different, their hair
completley silver, higher cheeck bones, and pointed thin ears now replace
their generic human apperances.
	A wind begins to blow, isolated in the clearing, gradually picking up
speed along with the strange chanting, and begins to take a shape in the
center of the circle they are chanting around.  A form begins to shape from
the dust and wind in the center and a blinding flash.  A blink of the eye
later the chanting stops, a figure stands in the center, and the strange
apperance of the people has returned to generic human.
