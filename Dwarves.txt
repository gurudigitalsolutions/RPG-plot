Although their connection with "magic" is not as strong as some alternate empires,
dwarves have  maintained a peaceful coexistance within the confines of the rocky,
difficult to reach interiors of various mountain chains throughout the world.  Being
spread so far and wide has undoubtedly fragmented the dwarvish empire, while creating
a very diverse race.

Over time, as dwarves have spread apart, their nobility has retained an ability to
communicate regardless of "technology."  This communication has nver been very
verbose, or even officially recognized, but is certainly an asset.  Clans that reside
continents apart are able to signal danger and prosperity to each other.  When one
dwarven tribe is in danger, the others know, and help when they can.
