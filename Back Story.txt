In the year 3573, the humans could not stop their civil wars.  All of the other
species had been at peace for millenia, but the humans had never mastered it.  During
the battle of Rolling Tree Sillohette, a rouge human clan launched an all out attack.

The electro-magnetic pulses and dirty bombs wipe out the grid and created a panic
in the world.  Most human technology was destroyed, including the great electronic
libraries that stored most information known to man.

The destruction was so devastating that the veil between the world of "tech" and
"magic" failed, along with the protection is provided.  The alternate empires rose to
protect the remnants of the earth.

Humans and dwarves have never believed in magic other than religous miracles, and
even those were mostly wiped out during the early 22nd century.  Elves and trolls
have always understood the ways of the universe, and have no problem harnessing the
power it provides.

The demons have lived amongst the humans since the beginning of time.  They have been
critical to the failure of the human's peace efforts since civilization began,
feeding off the humans inherrant emotional spectrum, subtly influencing the nature of
existance.

Because of the prehistoric brain of humans, they have never been able to recognize
demons as a foreign entity.  Demons however have always been interconnected in the
ether.  When the rogue humans finally pulled the annahilistic trigger, the parasitic
demons split ways.  They only wanted a stable host, and knew their run was over.
