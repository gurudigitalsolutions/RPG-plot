Trip
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Born after the Great Event, Trip has only known a world where the legends of
human technology far exceed their current state.  While there are places and
things far more advanced than the 21st century, nothing is what it could be.
The elders have had an incredibly difficult time adjusting to the new tribal
ways of life, but the youth like Trip have known nothing else.

Having access to random gadgets and devices, Trip has always had a knack for
assembling what he needs and making things work.  He is no stranger to
tinkering, analyzing, and reverse engineering.  In the 21st century, he would
almost certainly be considered a hacker.
